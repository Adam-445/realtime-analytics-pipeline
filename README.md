# Real-Time Analytics Pipeline [![Project Status: Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-success.svg)]()

A scalable, real-time analytics pipeline for processing and visualizing event streams. Built with an event-driven architecture using modern tools like Kafka, Flink, Redis, and FastAPI, this system demonstrates low-latency stream processing and end-to-end data flow suitable for high-throughput environments.

> **Note**: This project builds upon the foundational work done in the [lab repository](https://github.com/Adam-445/analytics-pipeline-lab) and extends it into a production-grade system.
